00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,477
In this lesson, we're going to
be talking about finance.

2
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:09,309
And one of the most important
aspects of finance is interest.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,155
When I go to a bank or some
other lending institution

4
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:17,220
to borrow money, the bank is happy
to give me that money. But then I'm

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,780
going to be paying the bank for the
privilege of using their money. And that

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,740
amount of money that I pay the bank is
called interest. Likewise, if I put money

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,520
in a savings account or I purchase a
certificate of deposit, the bank just

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,900
doesn't put my money in a little box
and leave it there until later. They take

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,122
my money and lend it to someone
else. So they are using my money.

10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,700
The bank has to pay me for the privilege
of using my money.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,000
Now what makes banks
profitable is the rate

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,630
that they charge people to use the bank's
money is higher than the rate that they

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:59,020
pay people like me to use my money. The
amount of interest that a person pays or

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,940
earns is dependent on three things. It's
dependent on how much money is involved.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,600
It's dependent upon the rate of interest
being paid or the rate of interest being

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,198
charged. And it's also dependent upon
how much time is involved. If I have

17
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:20,030
a loan and I want to decrease the amount
of interest that I'm going to pay, then

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,340
I'm either going to have to decrease how
much money I borrow, I'm going to have

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,720
to borrow the money over a shorter period
of time, or I'm going to have to find a

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,579
lending institution that charges a lower
interest rate. On the other hand, if I

21
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,880
want to earn more interest on my
investment, I'm going to have to invest

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,260
more money, leave the money in the
account for a longer period of time, or

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,770
find an institution that will pay
me a higher interest rate.
